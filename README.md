# OllamaVision
An extension for SwarmUI that allows you to connect to Ollama to use vision models for image analysis to create image prompts.

This extension is for [SwarmUI](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI) a Web-UI frontend for ComfyUI. If you don't already, go there and install now. If you're here I would imagine you already have it running.
