# OllamaVision
An extension for SwarmUI that allows you to connect to Ollama to use vision models for image analysis to create image prompts.

This extension is for [SwarmUI](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI) a Web-UI frontend for ComfyUI. If you haven't already, go there and install now. If you're here I would imagine you already have it running.

This extension connects to [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as a backend for image analysis. You will need to install this and download a LLAVA based Vision model such as llama3.2-vision. Ollama's website has a full, extensive library of models to choose from. I have been using ### benzie/llava-phi-3 with a lot of success. Though I would suggest trying a few models based on your specs. For most uses in this extension a 3B model will do just fine.

This is the BETA version, as of right now there is not a built in screenshot tool. You will have to use either Windows built-in snip tool "Windows+Shift+S" to grab a screenshot. You can then paste it into the extension directly. Any image you have saved in the clipboard can be pasted to the extension. I.E. "right click, copy image, paste into OllamaVision".  You can also choose any file you might have saved on your drive(s).
